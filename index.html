                <h2>How Hackers Use Links and QR Codes</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most common methods attackers use is through malicious links or QR codes. These methods involve tricking users into visiting a website or executing commands that can steal personal information or compromise devices.
                </p>

                <h3>Malicious Links</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hackers can send malicious links through emails, social media, or messages.</li>
                    <li>These links might appear legitimate, but they often redirect users to fake websites designed to steal login credentials or install malware.</li>
                    <li>Always double-check the linkâ€™s actual URL before clicking by hovering over it, especially in suspicious emails.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>QR Codes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>QR codes are increasingly used to direct users to websites, but they can easily be tampered with or replaced by malicious codes.</li>
                    <li>Hackers may use QR codes to execute commands on your device without your knowledge or take you to phishing websites.</li>
                    <li>Always verify the source of a QR code before scanning, especially in untrusted environments.</li>
                </ul>
